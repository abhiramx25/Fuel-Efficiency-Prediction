Fuel Efficiency Prediction

Overview:
This project predicts fuel efficiency (City MPG) using Multiple Linear Regression.


1. Data Preprocessing (renaming columns, handling missing values, removing outliers)
2. Model Training & Evaluation (train-test split, regression model, performance metrics)
3. Visualization (actual vs. predicted values)
